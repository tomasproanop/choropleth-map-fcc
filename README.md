# Choropleth Map - freeCodeCamp
Visualize Data with a Choropleth Map - 4th Data Visualization Project from freeCodeCamp 

In the Data Visualization Certification, I learned to build charts, graphs and maps to present 
different types of data with the D3.js library.

I'll also learned about JSON and how to work with data online using an API.
